== INSTALLATION ==

Since PCL does not support KinFu anymore, the source code of KinFu was just copy-pasted into the pcl_kinfu_large_scale folder.
This node now compiles like a common ROS node, except that:
  - You need a working CUDA installation and a CUDA-capable NVidia video card (minimum Compute Capability: 3.0)
  - To enable the package, you have to rename cmake/KinfuTrigger.cmake.readme into cmake/KinfuTrigger.cmake

== KNOWN ISSUES ==

- Malfunctions have been reported when compiling without optimizations, which unfortunately is the default for catkin_make.
  Make sure optimizations are enabled for your workspace. Examples:
    For catkin_make: $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    For catkin build: $ catkin build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

== INSTALLATION ==

Since PCL does not support KinFu any more, the source code of KinFu was just copy-pasted in the pcl_kinfu_large_scale folder.
This node now compiles like a common ROS node, except that:
  - You need a working CUDA installation
  - You need to rename the file cmake/KinfuTrigger.cmake.readme to KinfuTrigger.cmake
